# time_fractions

For video playback (youtube, or vlc), when changing the playback rate (eg 1.5, 0.75, etc), this calculator will display what the new playback time is.

- It uses flutter_bloc

## Getting Started

Enter the 'Time Amount' when '.' is a time marker (eg none: seconds, first: minutes, seconds: hours, etc).

The 'Time Factor' is a double to adjust the 'Time Amount' by (eg playback at 1.25 speed)

The display shows a column of play information:

- seconds
- minutes + seconds
- hours + minutes + seconds

## Final Note

Be kind to each other
